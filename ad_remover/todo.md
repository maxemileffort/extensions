# Ad Remover Extension - TODO List

This document outlines potential improvements and new features for the Ad Remover Chrome extension to enhance its performance and capabilities.

## High Priority

*   **Implement a more robust ad-blocking mechanism:**
    *   Explore using a declarativeNetRequest API for more efficient and privacy-preserving ad blocking.
    *   Investigate machine learning models to dynamically identify and block new ad patterns.
*   **Improve performance:**
    *   Optimize content scripts to minimize impact on page load times.
    *   Reduce memory footprint of the extension.
*   **User Interface for Customization:**
    *   Add a popup UI to allow users to whitelist/blacklist sites.
    *   Provide options to enable/disable specific ad-blocking rules.

## Medium Priority

*   **Enhanced Ad Detection:**
    *   Implement heuristic analysis to detect ads that bypass simple CSS/XPath rules.
    *   Integrate with community-maintained ad-block lists (e.g., EasyList).
*   **Contextual Ad Blocking:**
    *   Develop logic to differentiate between legitimate content and ads, reducing false positives.
*   **Reporting Mechanism:**
    *   Allow users to report unblocked ads to improve the extension's effectiveness.

## Low Priority

*   **Localization:**
    *   Support multiple languages for the extension's UI (if a UI is implemented).
*   **Telemetry (Opt-in):**
    *   Gather anonymous usage data to understand ad patterns and improve blocking (with user consent).
*   **Dark Mode Support:**
    *   Ensure the extension's popup UI (if implemented) supports dark mode.
